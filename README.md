# Exam-Calendar
:calendar:
This is a project that was inspired by the application of the graph theory to find the most suitable exam calendar using less days.

It uses a file that already has the data we need. It consists of the choice subjects for all the students; "data.txt" is a small file that I created to test my work. For example, the first line comprises the courses that the first student is enrolled into. You can enrich it, if you want, with other lines. Yet, it must end with "/" as shown in the initial text to prevent bugs.


*How to use this project:

Execute the projet.py file, it will automatically execute the last part which does the initialization and displays a suggestion for the final exam time-table using less days and ensuring that no student has two exams the same day.
